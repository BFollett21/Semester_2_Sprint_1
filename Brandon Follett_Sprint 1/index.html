        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="about">
          Our story startes all the way back in kindergarten. Me and my 
          best friend whose name rhymes with Very Frown, both had a dream 
          of setting out and starting our very own chicken restaurant. But, 
          as we got older we grew apart and she started her own business without
          me. So one day I said to myself "Why don't we have a little friendly 
          fried chicken competition?" and thats when Gary <span>Blue's</span> 
          was born. As of today we have as many locations across the province 
          as my good friend Very Frown, and because of this there are no losers 
          in our competition and the only winners are you, the customer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Locations</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="location">
          You can find a Gary <span>Blue's</span> Diner conveniently and 
          coincidentally directly across the street from each and every 
          one of our competitors locations. (You know, the one that rhymes
           with Very Frown's).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Hours of Operation</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="hours">
          All of our locations are open from 9:30 a.m. - 1:00 a.m. So you 
          can always feel the <span><strong>Blue's</span></strong>. 
          (Conveniently and coincidentally open a full hour earlier and we 
          don't close for a whole hour later than our competition, 
          who rhymes with Very Frown's.)
